### Prompt Collapse for SillyTavern
---
As the name implies, this is a script which adds a button to each prompt in the prompt manager. When clicked it will remove said prompt from the list and place it as a small box with it's initial at the top. 
This was done to clean up the prompt manager, as I personally use custom prompt all the time and certain prompts such as: Char description, Persona, Enhance definition etc.. Are always visible and can't be removed.

Now you can toggle them off (visibility) to clean up the prompt manager. It's good shit.
